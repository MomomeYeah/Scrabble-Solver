- Inconsistent use of cell.tile vs. cell.isEmpty
- UI Enhancements
    - clear visual distinction between existing and newly-placed tiles
    - use contexts + prop types
    - Switch to Redux for state
- Tests for solver
- Solve when words already on the board
    - Move all move-finding functions to Solver.ts
    - Move generation currently will use a lettered Tile OR a blank, but it can't try both possibilities
    - Don't bother having a separate function for getting first move - just set centre square to be anchor?
    - Is there a nicer way of building words with no existing prefix, to avoid having to check that it crosses anchor?
- Fully solve final moves once bag is empty
- Add validation at various points to make sure that e.g. moves place tiles in valid positions
