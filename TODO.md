- Inconsistent use of cell.tile vs. cell.isEmpty
- use contexts + prop types
- Switch to Redux for state
- Tests for solver
- Solve when words already on the board
    - Store directional prefixes for all cells
    - Store directional sum of prefix and suffix tiles for all cells
    - Function to generate prefixes with a given maximum length?
        - Constrained by tiles in the rack
        - None of the prefixes may be words
        - Function to count empty prefix cells
    - Move all move-finding functions to Solver.ts
    - Move generation currently will use a lettered Tile OR a blank, but it can't try both possibilities
- Fully solve final moves once bag is empty
- Add validation at various points to make sure that e.g. moves place tiles in valid positions
