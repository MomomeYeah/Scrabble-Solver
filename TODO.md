- Inconsistent use of cell.tile vs. cell.isEmpty
- UI Enhancements
    - clear visual distinction between existing and newly-placed tiles
    - smoother experience when entering tiles on board / rack
        - automatically highlight next square?
        - arrow keys to change direction?
    - smoother experience for entering multiple words in sequence
        - accept suggested word and continue?
    - use contexts + prop types
    - Switch to Redux for state
- Tests for solver
    - words with a blank tile at edge of the board form a valid word
    - words with an existing tile at edge of the board form a valid word
    - all cross-words form valid words
    - able to connect multiple fragment in one direction
    - able to form words with existing prefix
    - able to form words with no existing prefix
    - able to place e.g. ACROSS words immediately above other ACROSS words
- Code Tidy-Up
    - Move all move-finding functions to Solver.ts?
    - Feels like it should be possible to condense solving functions somewhat
    - Ensure naming is consistent and intuitive across the board
    - Move generation currently will use a lettered Tile OR a blank, but it can't try both possibilities
        - This may not be true - need to test
    - Don't bother having a separate function for getting first move - just set centre square to be anchor?
    - Is there a nicer way of building words with no existing prefix, to avoid having to check that it crosses anchor?
- Fully solve final moves once bag is empty
- Add validation at various points to make sure that e.g. moves place tiles in valid positions
